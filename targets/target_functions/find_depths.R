# Title: Function that uses the calculated depth of the pressure transducer and the depth of the sensor when it comes out of the water to determine the depth of the sensors.

# Edited: 04 Nov 2025 - changed the format of the offset file to make it a long format and to make the function cleaner with less arguments for a pre and post move.
